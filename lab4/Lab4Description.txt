Script 1


The first script first includes a formatted line using the echo command.
It then extracts all blocks of line comments. These start with //+ and 
end //-. It then uses the sed command to replace the comment characters with 
emptiness and makes sure to only check files that end in .c or .h. 



Script 2

The second script takes in a path as an argument and finds all the .c files
to produce the following information. For source files, it displays the path
of the file and the number of printf and fprintf. For module files, it displays
the path of the file and the numbers of the lines that contain printk.
To accomplish this, two variables called mainCheck and modCheck are declared
and initialized to false. The program uses the grep command to check for "int main"
or "init_module". It then sets the corresponding check variable to true and uses
grep with either a -c flag for count or -n flag for line number. Any check variable that 
is left as false will have a corresponding message stating there are no main files or 
no module files.
