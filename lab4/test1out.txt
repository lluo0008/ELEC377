 File:	shell.c

 Pupose: 	This program implements a simple shell program. It does not start
		processes at this point in time. However, it will change directory
		and list the contents of the current directory.

		The commands are:
		   cd name > change to directory name, print an error if the directory doesn't exist.
		              If there is no parameter, then change to the home directory.
		   ls > list the entries in the current directory.
			      If no arguments, then ignores entries starting with .
			      If a then all entries
		   pwd > print the current directory.
		   exit > exit the shell (default exit value 0)

		if the command is not recognized an error is printed.

 Returns:	Number of arguments (< maxargs).



 Function:	doCommand

 Purpose:	This command calls a command handling funciton from
