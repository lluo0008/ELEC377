Comments:
The code compiled and worked correctly.
The tests were ok.
The code documentation is good.
There's a minor mistake were lock is defined as a pointer in common.h, but the code is working correctly anyway since the pointer is also similar to integer.
Need more comments... but no point is deducted.
