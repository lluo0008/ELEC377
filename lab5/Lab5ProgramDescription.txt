SELFCOMP.c
This writes contents of 'exploit' array to buffer in 'foo' method.
The 'nop' instructions are used at the beginning of the exploit to ensure
the return address at the end of the exploit is aligned at the end of the 
stick in the 'foo' method. After this, the 'eip' register takes the address returned by 'foo'. 
This causes the program counter to point to the beginning of the exploit code.
The program counter now executes the exploit as it increments continuously. 
The output of this program is in test1.txt.

Buffer Address:    0x40,0x97,0x04,0x08
Total NOP Instructions:  2 NOP Padding 
String Size:              105 = 2 NOP Padding + 103 exploit commands + 1 Null Characters 

CLIENT.c
The main function of the client.c is to send the exploit string to the server.
The 'gets' function read this data from the client. The exploit is executed on the
server and uses the 'cat' command to print '/etc/passwd/' file which is then
sent back to the client. 
Th output was saved into test2.txt.

Buffer Address:    0x40,0x9c,0x04,0x08, 
Total NOP Instructions:   25 NOP Padding 
String Size:              130 = 103 exploit commands + 25 NOP Padding + 1 Newline Character + 1 Null Character

EXPLOIT
The exploit code is given in assembly, its unix equivalent is:
 	
 	sh -c "cat /etc/passwd; exit"

The main goal of the exploit is to adjust the program counter to point to 
the beginning of the code we want to execute. It does this by writing a buffer to
the stack, this causes the return address to overflow into the beginning of the 
exploit. The system call for the 'execve' is 0x0b, stored in eax. The name of this 
command is '/bin/sh', stored in ebx. The ecx register contains a pointer to the
arguments of the command above. The edx register contains null.

This structure has to be organized in memory during compilation to make sure
the return address points to the beginning of the exploit.
