File names: test1.txt, test2.txt

We performed the following tests:

test1.txt: This file contains the output after running "selfcomp", which will retrieve the file at /etc/passwrd and print it.

test2.txt: This file contains the output after running the server and client in the form of "server {port}", and then "client {port}" on a second console window. This will do the same thing, and retrieve the file at /etc/passwrd and print it.
