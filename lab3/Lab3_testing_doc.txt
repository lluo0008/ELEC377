File names: inputTest1.txt, inputTest2.txt, outTest1.txt, outTest2.txt

We performed the following tests:

Before conducting any tests, the memory will be reinitiated as 0 by running the command "meminit".

inputTest1.txt: a text file containing characters that are all on the same line.
inputTest2.txt: a text file containing multiple lines of characters.

outTest1.txt: initially created as a blank text file, and had the consumer output to this file. The output in this file is the result of running 2 producers at the same time, one reading from inputTest1.txt and the other reading form inputTest2.txt, and the consumer outputs both producers' reads into this file.
outTest2.txt: initially created as a blank text file, and had the consumer output to this file. The output in this file is the result of running a single producer reading from inputTest1.txt, and the consumer outputting it into this file.

When running multiple producers, each producer will be running in a separate console. The consumer will also be running in a separate console from all of the producers.
