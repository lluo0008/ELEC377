Comments:
The code documentation is ok, but can be better by adding some structure to it. 
Your tests are not as expected, where we asked that you should print out information similar to lab2 using ps. The correct instruction would have been 'ps -eo pid,uid,rss,vsz', not just 'ps -A'. You are not printing out relevant information about memory as a result. Please refer to the solutions in onQ for correct answer. But the test doc has identified the difference between ps and lab2 correctly.
Please consider adding comments to your codes. It is mandatory in future labs.
